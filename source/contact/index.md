I am currently not taking any commissions for the rest of the year, though if you believe you have something that may be interesting for me to paint, you're welcome to try and ask! No army painting commissions!

You are welcome to contact Itsacoyote Workshop by sending me an email directly. Otherwise you can also send a message through Facebook on my FB page - [Itsacoyote Workshop](http://facebook.com/itsacoyoteworkshop)
